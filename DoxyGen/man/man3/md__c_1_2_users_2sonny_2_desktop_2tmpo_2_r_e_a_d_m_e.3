.PP
Servo Control (SA01-SA04): (implemented)* Develop ROS nodes to control each degree of freedom of the robotic arm using servo motors\&. Ensure the ability to move servos to specified positions and adjust movement speed as required\&. (implemented)* Implement logic to account for differences in arm configurations, such as variations in servo orientations\&.
.PP
Predefined Positions (PO01-PO03): (implemented)* Define predefined positions for the arm, such as Park, Ready, and Straight up\&. Develop ROS services or actions to move the arm to these positions upon request\&.
.PP
Safety Features (VE01-VE03): (implemented)* Implement emergency stop functionality to halt arm movement immediately in case of emergencies\&. (implemented)* Enforce limits on servo motion to ensure it stays within safe ranges\&. (implemented)* Ensure the arm initializes safely upon startup, moving to a predefined safe position\&.
.PP
Operational Information (INF01-INF03): (implemented)* Provide operational information via ROS logging mechanisms at appropriate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING)\&. Include state information, event notifications, and warnings for delayed actions\&.
.PP
Queueing of Commands (EX01): (not implemented)* Implement a command queue to manage multiple commands, allowing for queuing, dequeuing, and clearing of commands\&. Ensure the queue is emptied during emergency stops\&.
.PP
Documentation (SY01-SY04):
.IP "\(bu" 2
Document the system design, including use cases, subsystem decomposition, component diagrams, system behavior using state diagrams, and interfaces\&. (implemented)* Provide detailed documentation for the ROS nodes, services, and actions developed, including API documentation generated with Doxygen\&.
.PP
.PP
System Description (SY01-SY04):
.IP "\(bu" 2
Describe the system architecture, interfaces, and ports using component diagrams\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Use state diagrams to illustrate the system behavior in different states and transitions\&.
.PP
.PP
Demonstration (DE01-DE02):
.IP "\(bu" 2
Develop a demo application that showcases the functionality of the software interface\&. (implemented)* Demonstrate the ability to initialize the arm, move it to predefined positions, execute sequential movements, trigger emergency stops, and return to a safe position\&.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Clearly present and validate the achieved Quality of Service (QoS) during the demonstration\&.
