# Requirements

Servo Control (SA01-SA04):
* Develop ROS nodes to control each degree of freedom of the robotic arm using servo motors. Ensure the ability to move servos to specified positions and adjust movement speed as required.
* Implement logic to account for differences in arm configurations, such as variations in servo orientations.

Predefined Positions (PO01-PO03):
* Define predefined positions for the arm, such as Park, Ready, and Straight up. Develop ROS services or actions to move the arm to these positions upon request.


Safety Features (VE01-VE03):
* Implement emergency stop functionality to halt arm movement immediately in case of emergencies.
* Enforce limits on servo motion to ensure it stays within safe ranges.
* Ensure the arm initializes safely upon startup, moving to a predefined safe position.
* Operational Information (INF01-INF03):
* Provide operational information via ROS logging mechanisms at appropriate log levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING). Include state information, event notifications, and warnings for delayed actions.

Queueing of Commands (EX01):
*  Implement a command queue to manage multiple commands, allowing for queuing, dequeuing, and clearing of commands. Ensure the queue is emptied during emergency stops.

Documentation (SY01-SY04):
* Document the system design, including use cases, subsystem decomposition, component diagrams, system behavior using state diagrams, and interfaces.
* Provide detailed documentation for the ROS nodes, services, and actions developed, including API documentation generated with Doxygen.

System Description (SY01-SY04):
* Describe the system architecture, interfaces, and ports using component diagrams.
* Use state diagrams to illustrate the system behavior in different states and transitions.

Demonstration (DE01-DE02):
* Develop a demo application that showcases the functionality of the software interface.
* Demonstrate the ability to initialize the arm, move it to predefined positions, execute sequential movements, trigger emergency stops, and return to a safe position.
* Clearly present and validate the achieved Quality of Service (QoS) during the demonstration.
